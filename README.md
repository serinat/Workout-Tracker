# Workout-Tracker

- A consumer will reach their fitness goals quicker when they track their workout progress. As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

- The objective of this assignment is to develop a workout tracker by creating a Mongo database with a mongoose schema, using Express to handle api and html routes. When the page is loaded, the user is given an option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout. More specifically, exercises can be added to a previous workout plan, new exercises can be added to a new workout plan and finally combined weight of multiple exercises can be view on the stats page.
